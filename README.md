Celts Altis Life

Celts Clan Arma 3 Altis Life RPG Multiplayer mission

This version of Altis Life is hosted by the guys at Celts Clan, I'm just a regular on the server who wants to help out a little.

Warning! This is a work in progress, I will put up more information when there is actually something to show :D

How To Edit:
================
Ok first of all we need to get the mission into the Editor:
- simply create a shortcut of the AltisLife.Altis server and place it in your Arma 3 Other Profile user folder under MPMissions
- Start Arma 3 as always
- Go to Multiplayer and new
- Start a LAN server
- Select the Altis Life RPG and hit Edit
Tada! You now can move stuff, rename stuff and all kinds of other fun things to the mission!

Thats it for now, I'm gona go and play Altis Life a little :)

Disclaimer: This is not a fork of the original Altis Life repo you can find at https://github.com/TAWTonic/Altis-Life, all credit for this mod goes to the guys there especially Tonic himself. Depending on how things are going I might consider putting in the work to merge this into a fork but no guarantees.
