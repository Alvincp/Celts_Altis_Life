Celts Altis Life - Missions
================

This directory contains code related to "Player Missions", aka. functionality like robbing the federal reserve etc.

We here at Celts want to add more content to our server which forces players to work together and especially pitches the different sides (cops, gangs, rebels etc.) against each other. Another approach to this topic is to add functionality like the Jewelers, however the overall complexity of such a generic functionality is rather limited.

Introducing MISSIONS (or however we call it in the future) the ideas behind it are:
* distinct game play feature, or simply said its somewhat special and not something you just do while nobody is around
* multi stage progression, no grab and run - preferably the following stages should be the minimum: plan, prepare, acquire the goods, defend them and get home safely.
* Overall time required (from planning to getting home) should be at least 20 minutes but preferably not exceed 1 hour (under normal circumstances - if you have a lot of fun it should go as long as possible :D ) 
* the gameplay MUST be aimed at groups of players and preferably not only require players of one side to work together but as well force a confrontation with another side or party (its not worth to put all this work into this stuff if its just for one player)

Federal Reserve:
================
Essentially just a refactoring of the current Federal Reserve functionality to pull it together in a single location and to fix up some of the edge cases.

Capture Casino:
================
Stage 1: will be a simple capture (like you would capture a gang hideout) which result in some kind of payment to the gang members or gang funds - we are still working on the details

Stage 2: A "vault" functionality is added to casino which allows civs to break into the casino and steal cash bundles which then have to be laundered to turn it into life cash - again the details are still being worked out.
